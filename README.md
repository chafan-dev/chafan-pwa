# Chafan PWA

## Local development setup

**Step 1: Install dependencies**

First, install NodeJS, npm and yarn on your OS. Then:

```
yarn install
```

Build for development and run hot-reload website:

```
yarn run serve
```

The default server connected in this setting is hosted at https://chafan-test.herokuapp.com with free dyno.
Thus, **it might be slow when you open it since the dyno will be suspended when unused for a long time and will
take a minute to restart**.

Open the "Network" URL in your browser.

## Showcase

When developing locally, you can see `/showcase` for individual static components, for exploration and design purpose. For example:

## Build production and serve locally through https

```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
